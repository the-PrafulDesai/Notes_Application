## Procto Backend Development Task
I am pleased to announce the successful completion of the Procto Company backend development task. This project involved the utilization of Python Flask, XAMPP for local hosting, and phpMyAdmin for efficient data management. The resulting application is a feature-rich CRUD note management system that seamlessly connects the frontend and backend components.

## Key Highlights
- Flask Backend: Developed a flexible Python Flask backend.
- Local Hosting: Used XAMPP for easy local testing.
- Efficient Data Management: Integrated phpMyAdmin for data reliability.
- CRUD Operations: Enable easy note creation, editing, and deletion.

Feel free to explore the code and design in this repository to assess my skills in frontend development and web design. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
